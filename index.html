                <p>Hello, and welcome to the world of Ryan. I am very new to web development, so be kind! My name is Ryan and I've been
                    around since 1984. I was born in Richmond, Virgina but moved quickly to Tampa, Florida. I attended Jesuit High School 
                    while in Tampa. After high school I moved to the suburbs of Philadelphia to attend Villanova University. I've bounced 
                    around the mainline ever since.
                </p>

                <p>At Villanova I majored in Psychology and Mathematics. With capstone projects on Timothy Leary and the Collatz Conjecture. 
                    Since university I have spent time on very different career paths. Right away I began in insurance, working on Long Term 
                    Disability products. After 6 years of that, I moved on and began working for a mobile canning company. 
                </p>
                <p>I spent 2 months canning beer before I was placed in charge of the logistics and scheduling aspects of our small operation. 
                    I love beer and breweries, and loved my job very much. When our company was purchased I had to make some hard decisions, 
                    and am very excited to make a career change.
                </p>
        
                <p>At the top of this page, you'll find a link to my portfolio, as well as an option to contact me with any questions,
                    comments, and feedback! Clicking on my name, or the
                    <strong>About</strong> link, will always bring you back to this page right here. I hope you enjoy my first website, and
                    many more to come!
                </p>
